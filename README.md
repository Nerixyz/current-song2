# Current Song 2

![example screenshot with default theme](https://github.com/Nerixyz/current-song2/assets/19953266/9b2ac5cd-4135-4eea-8383-bc738c865da9)

The documentation is located at [currentsong.nerixyz.de](https://currentsong.nerixyz.de).

This project is a rewrite of the [**CurrentSong Overlay**](https://github.com/Nerixyz/current-song-overlay). The core is
written in Rust now. Both Windows and Unix platforms are supported. On Windows, [`GlobalSystemMediaTransportControls`](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.media.control) is used and on Unix, D-Bus is used.

The goal of the project is to create a **simple yet powerful** overlay that displays the currently playing song. There
are a few unique features separating this project:

- **Near zero latency** ‚è± Current Song 2 doesn't poll applications or APIs for updates.
- **Displaying Progress** üíØ Progress is displayed where available.
- **Display Album Art** üñº
- **Customizable** üîß The overlay is customizable through CSS (`theme.css`) and JavaScript (`user.js`), see [Customization]. Modules and the server can be configured in
  a `config.toml` file, see [Configuration].
